Module 11

## Overview
The purpose of the analysis done was to create a user friendly way of searching through numerous ufo sightings compiled together on our data.js file. In order to do this we needed to create a script which would build the table data we would put on the webpage and then allow a user to filter through these sightings by either date, state, city, country, or vehicle shape.  By adding numerous list elements to our html file we built these search options which take in user input and update the table on the page to only show the relevant information requested by the user.
